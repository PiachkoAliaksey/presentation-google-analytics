Google Analytics
---

For first..What is web analytics? According to the Digital Analytics Association (formerly the web Analytics Association),web analytics is the ‘‘objective tracking, collection, mea-surement, reporting, and analysis of quantitative Internet data to optimize websites and web marketing initiatives’’. In other words, it is one of many tools that can be used to gain a better understanding of how people use a website in order to improve it. Historically, systems and IT departments paid top dollar for proprietary software like‘‘WebTrends’’ and ‘‘Omniture’’. Many organizations use proprietary software, but many small businesses and nonprofits choose to try out many of the free, or low-priced, web-based tools to get a sense of how their web sites are used. Google Analytics was one of the pioneer in gproducts in this arena.

What is Google Analytics?
---
Google Analytics is a powerful web analysis tool that can be used to monitor a wide array of statistics relating to a website's traffic. The data collected is mostly concerned with traffic acquisition (directing traffic to a website) and visitor behavior. This data, once analyzed, provides insights into the visitors' experience, and how to optimize the website and other marketing aspects. The service does not exclusively analyze websites, it can also apply to mobile apps. Google Analytics is designed to provide highly customizable reports offering users the data they need to shape their online marketing strategy and meet their goals.

HOW TO PUT THE GOOGLE ANALYTICS TRACKING CODE?
---
It’s recommended to add the Google Analytics tracking code in the header section (). According to Google: “The code should be added near the top of the tag and before any other script or CSS tags, and the string ‘UA-XXXXX-Y’ should be replaced with the property ID (also called the “tracking ID”) of the Google Analytics property you wish to track.”

DATA OF GOOGLE ANALYTICS 4
---
Let's look at an example of work Google Analytics 4 for Google Merchandise Store - online-store of Google souvenirs.

Reports snapshot - the home page summarizes overall traffic, conversions, and revenue for that property. This is best used as a quick check to make sure everything is behaving as expected.
Your home page report will quickly answer:
Where do new users come from?
What are your top-performing campaigns?
Which pages and screens get the most views?

Real time board 
Realtime report is the next default report in the left navigation, and it shows events that happened within the past 30 minutes.
With Real-Time, you can immediately and continuously monitor the effects that new campaigns and site changes have on your traffic. Here are a few of the ways you might use Real-Time:
- monitor whether new and changed content on your site is being viewed
- understand usage of your mobile app through event tracking
- see whether a one-day promotion is driving traffic to your site or app, and which pages these users are viewing
- monitor the immediate effects on traffic from a blog/social network post or tweet
- verify that the tracking code is working on your site or app
- monitor goal completions as you test changes to your site

Cool Feature: “View User Snapshot”
Click View user snapshot in the top right corner of the Real time report to see a literal snapshot for a single user.
This includes information about the user’s device, location, and real-time engagement with the site/app through events triggered.
Life cycle
Life Cycle reporting mirrors the funnel of acquiring, engaging, monetizing, and retaining users.
The collection includes the following reports by default:

Acquisition provides information about where your traffic originates, the methods by which users arrive at your site or app, and the marketing efforts you use to drive traffic
Engagement lets you measure user engagement by the events and conversion events that users trigger and the web pages and app screens that users visit
Monetization enables you to see the revenue you generate from the items, ads, and subscriptions on your website or app
Retention helps you understand how frequently and for how long users engage with your website or mobile app after their first visit
Google Analytics replaces the Life cycle collection with a Games reporting collection when any of the following apply to you

Explorer Reports: Analysis
This may be the most powerful change in GA4.
While default reports help you monitor key business metrics, the GA4 Analysis Hub gives you access to several advanced techniques and a template gallery that isn’t available anywhere else.
Path exploration
The path exploration techniques lets you do things like:
Find the top pages that new users open after opening the home page.
Discover what actions users take after an app exception.
Uncover looping behavior which may indicate users becoming stuck.
Determining the effects of an event on subsequent users actions.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Google Analytics

**Advanteges**

- Increased Visibility
Ultimately, Google Analytics works as a one-stop shop for all of your website data. It not only allows you to see your website’s performance across a range of different time scales but also compare the performance of different channels, platforms, technologies, demographics and campaigns all in one place!
- Decision Maker
One of the biggest pros of using Google Analytics is the insights you can take from the data. Looking at the site performance means you can make judgements on what aspects of the site are working well and which need improvement, allowing you to better tailor your efforts and maximise its return. Plus, all of these decisions and changes are made based on real customers on your site as opposed to assumptions and guesses which were used prior.
- It’s Completely Free!
Google Analytics is free of charge so everyone can use it. However, sadly this does have a limit. When your site exceeds 5 million impressions per month, you are required to pay for Google Analytics 360 which is a hefty $150,000 per year. While that seems like a lot of money, this is targeted at large corporations as opposed to SMEs. Plus, when your site reaches 5 million impressions per month, there is an assumption that you should be able to meet this cost demand. If not, then I think there is a need to revisit your website usability!
- Resources At Hand
For new users, Google Analytics has its very own Analytics Academy which works as a hub of information on how to use the tool. It has four, easy-to-use, step-by-step courses ranging from beginner to advanced so you won’t be left in the dark with this one!
- It’s Universal
With Google Analytics being a universal tool, means anyone, anywhere, can jump into your Google Analytics account and understand how your website is performing. This is particularly attractive for business owners working with third parties overseas such as international clients or agencies.
- Can Be Used Across Multiple Devices
Another great thing about Google Analytics is that it is not restricted to just desktop devices. You can open the tools on any device such as a mobile or tablet as long as it has an internet connection. Perfect for business owners who are often on the move wanting to browse the account or need to access it in the instance of an error on the account.

**Disadvantages of Google Analytics**

- It’s Still Limited
While Google Analytics offers copious amounts of information on your website performance, it is still somewhat limited. For example, the Google Analytics 360 account has much higher data collection limits, more data importing and product integration options as well as reporting improvements just to name a few.
Not Entirely Independent
Google’s Analytics tool is arguably the most reliable and accurate, however, it is still technically Google reporting on Google’s performance, making it not entirely independent. For example, when looking at organic traffic in Acquisition reports, this is Google reporting on how well Google search engines drove users to the site. While this doesn’t display shiny, gold performance each time, its validity is questionable.
- It’s Complex
Google Analytics can be confusing and overwhelming for new users. In order to understand all of its complexities, you need to learn. The issue with this it that is can be fairly time-consuming to sit through the training, practice the tool and become familiar with where the information is. So if you have a time frame, it may not be feasible.
- Reliability Is Questionable
Google Analytics is known to report things incorrectly. For example, when using the default channel grouping settings within acquisition reports, you will often find traffic is reported under the wrong source such as social traffic appearing as a referral. This skews figures making the data less accurate and therefore less reliable. Similarly, spam and bot traffic are often reported in Google Analytics causing the same issue. The extra annoyance with incorrect reporting is that it cannot be deleted, so when you come to analyse and review data across that specific date range in future, figures will be inaccurate.

Finally, Google Analytics is a vast and informative tool. As a completely free complement to any eCommerce business, you’d be foolish to ignore the sheer volume of data specifically tailored to your site, despite its notable drawbacks.
